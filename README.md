# Perl---Cosmology-Distances

These scripts were adapted from the FORTRAN source to Perl :

# From a fortran program by Benjamin Weiner
# http://mingus.as.arizona.edu/~bjw/software/
# DISTCALC - calculate luminosity distances and such
#            see David Hogg's paper, astro-ph/9905116

I have used them to generate a Luminosity vs Redshift plots of ATLAS DR3 sources XID by LRPY with the SWIRE Fusion Catalogue. We now also have the OzDES redshifts.
